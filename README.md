# calling-all-beings
So many names to go by, to use and subsequently be used by. Named by nationality, by ethnicity, by race and color and language and by class and rank and gender and sexual orientation. Even by size. Well, how about we align with one name we all have which also stands above all other names given and taken? We are human beings, and we know going by the name human doesn't unite us with all other life forms, all other... Beings. So there you go. We are Beings, it's a noun and not only a verb, and it stands above all other names we use and are used by. Seriously. Go check out wearebeings.com and make sure you look at the charts in downloadable pdf format. 

Take time with this. Language as we use it, easily said manufactured into a lyinguage we use on one another, must be raised to represent life above all existential beliefs, symbols, names, codes, industrialization and politicization and all around mistreatments of all life hence all lives, all living Beings. This explicitally demonstrates how vital it is to distinguigh the word "life" from the word "existence". Symbols only exist. Symbols do not live. This one fact alone makes it so. Anyway, there's more. It's on. Write me! Thank you and visit wearebeings.com
